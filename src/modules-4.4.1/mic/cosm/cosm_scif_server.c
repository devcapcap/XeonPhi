/*
 * The COSM driver uses SCIF to communicate between the management node and the
 * MIC cards. SCIF is used to (a) Send a shutdown command to the card (b)
 * receive a shutdown status back from the card upon completion of shutdown and
 * (c) receive periodic heartbeat messages from the card used to deduce if the
 * card has crashed.
 *
 * A COSM server consisting of a SCIF listening endpoint waits for incoming
 * connections from the card. Upon acceptance of the connection, a separate
 * work-item is scheduled to handle SCIF message processing for that card. The
 * life-time of this work-item is therefore the time from which the connection
 * from a card is accepted to the time at which the connection is closed. A new
 * work-item starts each time the card boots and is alive till the card (a)
 * shuts down (b) is reset (c) crashes (d) cosm_client driver on the card is
 * unloaded.
 *
 * From the point of view of COSM interactions with SCIF during card
 * shutdown, reset and crash are as follows:
 *
 * Card shutdown
 * -------------
 * 1. COSM client on the card invokes orderly_poweroff() in response to SHUTDOWN
 *    message from the host.
 * 2. Card driver shutdown callback invokes scif_unregister_device(..) resulting
 *    in scif_remove(..) getting called on the card
 * 3. scif_remove -> scif_stop -> scif_handle_remove_node ->
 *    scif_peer_unregister_device -> device_unregister for the host peer device
 * 4. During device_unregister remove(..) method of cosm_client is invoked which
 *    closes the COSM SCIF endpoint on the card. This results in a SCIF_DISCNCT
 *    message being sent to host SCIF. SCIF_DISCNCT message processing on the
 *    host SCIF sets the host COSM SCIF endpoint state to DISCONNECTED and wakes
 *    up the host COSM thread blocked in scif_poll(..) resulting in
 *    scif_poll(..)  returning POLLHUP.
 * 5. On the card, scif_peer_release_dev is next called which results in an
 *    SCIF_EXIT message being sent to the host and after receiving the
 *    SCIF_EXIT_ACK from the host the peer device teardown on the card is
 *    complete.
 * 6. As part of the SCIF_EXIT message processing on the host, host sends a
 *    SCIF_REMOVE_NODE to itself corresponding to the card being removed. This
 *    starts a similar SCIF peer device teardown sequence on the host
 *    corresponding to the card being shut down.
 *
 * Card reset
 * ----------
 * The case of interest here is when the card has not been previously shut down
 * since most of the steps below are skipped in that case:

 * 1. cosm_stop(..) invokes hw_ops->stop(..) method of the base PCIe driver
 *    which unregisters the SCIF HW device resulting in scif_remove(..) being
 *    called on the host.
 * 2. scif_remove(..) calls scif_disconnect_node(..) which results in a
 *    SCIF_EXIT message being sent to the card.
 * 3. The card executes scif_stop() as part of SCIF_EXIT message
 *    processing. This results in the COSM endpoint on the card being closed and
 *    the SCIF host peer device on the card getting unregistered similar to
 *    steps 3, 4 and 5 for the card shutdown case above. scif_poll(..) on the
 *    host returns POLLHUP as a result.
 * 4. On the host, card peer device unregister and SCIF HW remove(..) also
 *    subsequently complete.
 *
 * Card crash
 * ----------
 * If a reset is issued after the card has crashed, there is no SCIF_DISCNT
 * message from the card which would result in scif_poll(..) returning
 * POLLHUP. In this case when the host SCIF driver sends a SCIF_REMOVE_NODE
 * message to itself resulting in the card SCIF peer device being unregistered,
 * this results in a scif_peer_release_dev -> scif_cleanup_scifdev->
 * scif_invalidate_ep call sequence which sets the endpoint state to
 * DISCONNECTED and results in scif_poll(..) returning POLLHUP.
