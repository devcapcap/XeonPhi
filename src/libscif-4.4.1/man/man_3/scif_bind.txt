NAME
----
scif_bind - Bind an endpoint to a port.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <scif.h>*

*int scif_bind(scif_epd_t* 'epd'*, uint16_t* 'pn'*);*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*scif_bind*() binds endpoint 'epd' to port 'pn', where 'pn' is a port number on the
local node. If 'pn' is zero, a port number greater than or equal to
*SCIF_PORT_RSVD* is assigned and returned. Each endpoint may be bound to
exactly one local port. Ports less than 1024 when requested can only be bound
by system (or root) processes or by processes executed by privileged users.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Upon successful completion, *scif_bind*() returns the port number to which 'epd'
is bound; otherwise -1 is returned and 'errno' is set to indicate the error errors is returned.

ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
  'epd' is not a valid endpoint descriptor, or the endpoint or the port are already bound.

*EISCONN*::
  The endpoint is already connected or listening.

*ENOSPC*::
  No port number available for assignment (when pn==0).

*EACCES*::
  The port requested is protected and the user is not the superuser.

NOTES
-----
None
