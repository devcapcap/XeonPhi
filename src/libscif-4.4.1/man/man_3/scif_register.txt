NAME
----
scif_register - Mark a memory region for remote access.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <scif.h>*

*off_t scif_register(scif_epd_t 'epd', void* \*'addr'*, size_t 'len', off_t 'offset',
int 'prot_flags', int 'map_flags');*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *scif_register*() function opens a window, a range of whole pages of the
registered address space of the endpoint 'epd', starting at offset 'po' and
continuing for 'len' bytes. The value of 'po', further described below, is a
function of the parameters 'offset' and 'len', and the value of 'map_flags'. Each
page of the window represents the physical memory page which backs the
corresponding page of the range of virtual address pages starting at 'addr'
and continuing for 'len' bytes. 'addr' and 'len' are constrained to be multiples
of the page size. 'addr' is interpreted as a user space address. A successful
*scif_register*() call returns 'po' as the return value.

When *SCIF_MAP_FIXED* is set in the 'map_flags' argument, 'po' will be 'offset'
exactly, and 'offset' is constrained to be a multiple of the page size. The
mapping established by *scif_register*() will not replace any existing
registration; an error is returned if any page within the range ['offset',
'offset'+'len'-1] intersects an existing window.
Note: When *SCIF_MAP_FIXED* is set, the current implementation limits
'offset' to the range [0..2\^62-1] and returns *EADDRINUSE* if the 'offset'
requested with *SCIF_MAP_FIXED* is in the range [2\^62..2^63-1].

When *SCIF_MAP_FIXED* is not set, the implementation uses 'offset' in an
implementation-defined manner to arrive at 'po'. The 'po' value so chosen will
be an area of the registered address space that the implementation deems
suitable for a mapping of 'len' bytes. An 'offset' value of 0 is interpreted as
granting the implementation complete freedom in selecting 'po', subject to
constraints described below. A non-zero value of 'offset' is taken to be a
suggestion of an offset near which the mapping should be placed. When the
implementation selects a value for 'po', it does not replace any extant
window. In all cases, 'po' will be a multiple of the page size.

The physical pages which are so represented by a window are available for
access in calls to *scif_mmap*(), *scif_readfrom*(), *scif_writeto*(),
*scif_vreadfrom*(), and *scif_vwriteto*(). While a window is registered, the
physical pages represented by the window will not be reused by the memory
subsystem for any other purpose. Note that the same physical page may be
represented by multiple windows.

Subsequent operations which change the memory pages to which virtual
addresses are mapped (such as *mmap*(), *munmap*(), *scif_mmap*() and
*scif_munmap*()) have no effect on existing windows.

On Linux, if the process will *fork*(), it is recommended that the registered
virtual address range be marked with *MADV_DONTFORK*. Doing so will prevent
problems due to copy-on-write semantics.

The 'prot_flags' argument is formed by OR'ing together one or more of the
following values:

*SCIF_PROT_READ*::
    allow read operations from the window

*SCIF_PROT_WRITE*::
    allow write operations to the window

The 'map_flags' argument is formed by OR'ing together zero or more of
the following values:

*SCIF_MAP_FIXED*::
    interpret 'offset' exactly

RETURN VALUE
------------
Upon successful completion, *scif_register*() returns the offset at which the
mapping was placed ('po'); otherwise *SCIF_REGISTER_FAILED* (that
is ('off_t' *)-1) is returned and 'errno' is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
*EADDRINUSE*::
 *SCIF_MAP_FIXED* is set in 'map_flags', and pages in the range
  ['offset','offset'+'len'-1] are already registered.

*EAGAIN*::
 The mapping could not be performed due to lack of resources.

*ECONNRESET*::
 A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.

*EFAULT*::
 Addresses in the range ['addr','addr'+'len'-1] are invalid.

*EINVAL*::
 'epd' is not a valid endpoint descriptor, or
 'map_flags' is invalid, or
 'prot_flags' is invalid, or
 *SCIF_MAP_FIXED* is set in 'flags', and 'offset' is not a multiple of
  the page size, or
 'addr' is not a multiple of the page size, or
 'len' is not a multiple of the page size, or is 0, or
 'offset' is negative.

*ENODEV*::
 The remote node is lost.

*ENOMEM*::
 Not enough space.

*ENOTCONN*::
 The endpoint is not connected.
