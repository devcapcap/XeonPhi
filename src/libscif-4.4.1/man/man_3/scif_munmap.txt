SCIF_MUNMAP(3)
==============
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
scif_munmap - Remove the mapping to a remote window.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <scif.h>*

*int scif_munmap(void **'addr'*, size_t 'len');*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*scif_munmap*() removes any mapping to those entire pages containing any
portion of the address space, starting at 'addr' and continuing for 'len' bytes.
Subsequent reference to those pages may result in the generation of a signal
or error.

If a page in the specified range was not mapped by *scif_mmap*(), the effect
will be as if the standard *mmap*() function were called on that page.

All mapped regions of a process are automatically unmapped when the process
is terminated.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Upon successful completion, scif_munmap() returns 0. Otherwise -1 is
returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
 'addr' is not a multiple of the page size, or
 'len' is not a multiple of the page size.

NOTES
-----
None

--------
