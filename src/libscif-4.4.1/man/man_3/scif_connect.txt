NAME
----
scif_connect - Initiate a connection on a port.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <scif.h>*

*int scif_connect(scif_epd_t* 'epd'*, struct scif_portID **'dst'*);*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *scif_connect*() function requests the connection of endpoint 'epd' to remote
port 'dst'. If the connection is successful, a peer endpoint, bound to 'dst', is
created on node dst.node. On successful return, the connection is complete.

If the endpoint 'epd' has not already been bound to a port, *scif_connect*()
will bind it to an unused local port.

A connection is terminated when an endpoint of the connection is closed,
either explicitly by *scif_close*(), or when a process that owns one of the
endpoints of a connection is terminated.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Upon successful completion, *scif_connect*() returns the port ID to which the
endpoint, 'epd', is bound; otherwise -1 is returned and errno is
set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
*ECONNREFUSED*::
 The destination was not listening for connections or refused the
 connection request.
*EINVAL*::
 'epd' is not a valid endpoint descriptor, or
 dst.port is not a valid port ID.
*EISCONN*::
 The endpoint is already connected.
*ENOMEM*::
 No buffer space is available.
*ENODEV*::
 The destination node does not exist, or
 The node is lost.
*ENOSPC*::
 No port number available for assignment (when pn==0).
*EOPNOTSUPP*::
 The endpoint is listening and cannot be connected.
