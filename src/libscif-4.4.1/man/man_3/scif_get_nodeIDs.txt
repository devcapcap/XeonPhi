NAME
----
scif_get_nodeIDs - Return information about online nodes.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <scif.h>*

*int scif_get_nodeIDs(uint16_t* \*'nodes'*, int* 'len'*, uint16_t* \*'self'*);*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*scif_get_nodeIDs*() fills in the 'nodes' array with up to 'len' node IDs of the
nodes in the SCIF network. If there is not enough space in 'nodes', as
indicated by the 'len' parameter, only 'len' node IDs are returned in 'nodes'. The
return value of *scif_get_nodeID*() is the total number of nodes currently in
the SCIF network. By checking the return value against the 'len' parameter, the user may
determine if enough space for 'nodes' was allocated.

The node ID of the local node is returned at 'self'.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Upon successful completion, *scif_get_nodeIDs*() returns the actual number of
online nodes in the SCIF network including 'self'; otherwise 1 is returned and
errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
*EFAULT*::
 Bad address.

NOTES
-----
None
